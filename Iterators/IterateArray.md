Iterating the items in an array
==============================
Simple example that shows differente ways to iterate through an array.

How to use the snippet
----------------------
To run this snippet you will need the WEKA and MULAN libraries (see instructions in [UseMULAN example](https://github.com/fcharte/ScalaSnippetsLibrary/blob/master/UseJavaLibraries/UseMulan.md)).

Run the snippet using the following syntax: `scala -cp "weka.jar;mulan.jar" IterateArray.scala`. The `emotions.arff` and `emotions.xml` must be available in the same directory. 

**NOTE**: You can change the script to use a simple array, instead of loading information from a MULAN dataset.

The following image shows the output produced by the snippet working with the `emotions` dataset:
